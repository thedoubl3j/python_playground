# python_playground
Repo to house my python learning. Work from the book learn python the hard way and others might be found here.
I am in the process of learning python, the commits here are everything that I have done via learning from multiple sources. 
If the file has `ex*` file name, it is most likely from the book Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw. 
Anything else should be in its own dir. 
Questions or concerns can be put in issues or you can reach out to me on twitter. @thedoubl3j
